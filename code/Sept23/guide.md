# Instructions/Guidance

<!-- To summarize the plan from today: -->

## Task1
1) Junjie will share the CSV of Shanghai with Jieun.  Probably she'll be fine with the unicode Chinese but she will contact Junjie directly if problems arise. Jieun will explore that dataset more to think about the project.  Call this dataset A.

## Task2
2) Junjie and Shuang will try to create a small but complete dataset from the court judgments. Call it Dataset B. For instance, it will search for all documents with 被执行 and 失信 for a short time frame (for example January 2017) and specific location (for example shanghai).  

## Task3
3) Then you will see whether you can link these documents forward to find whether they were blacklisted, and when they were published to the blacklist in Dataset A.  If it is not 100%, try to find out why.  Were they blacklisted and then removed (possibly the debt was paid off?).  

<!-- blacklisted -1-> 黑名单 |  失信黑名单 | 纳入失信黑名单 -->


## Task4
4) From the Shanghai blacklist (Dataset A) are there entries that should be in B (because of timing) but are not?  Can you figure out why?

## Task5
5) Can we find predictors of which entries in B will get blacklisted, or how long it takes them to get blacklisted?  For example gender, type of crime/debt, type of industry, SOE vs. foreign vs. private sector ownership?

## Task6
If time permits:
6) From Dataset B, can we link those 被执行 companies/people to the original court case?  How much work does this take?

## Task7
7) What would it take to create a data set of all court cases that could have become blacklistings? That is our original universe. From this we could predict under what circumstances a case is more likely to progress to 被执行 and blacklist.   This links to the idea that the blacklist is a substitute for "normal" (American) legal enforcement.  I want to understand why this is necessary in China.  I think the answer is that the legal system does not have enough power to punish some people directly, so it has to use a sort of public shame instead.
